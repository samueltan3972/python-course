# Introduction

Welcome to the Python for Chin course, custom designed for Chin. The course is aims to teach Chin on the most essential part of Python to allow her to do her job more efficiently as a Data Scientist, at the same time, refresh my memory. 

I may use the content in this course in my blog post in the future. Maybe la, if I can live until that day.

Before we jump start, let’s start by answering some question… ~~[I am supposed to answer question like What is automation, Why Python, etc. in this section, since this is custom for Chin (I am lazy), we will skip this part]~~

## Things to take note
But there are some things I need you to know before we start:

1. Python is not the only tools that can do the job; 
    > Python is also not the easiest way to do the job (RPA, UI, etc.);
    >
    > You should use Python only when it is needed;
    >
    > Just like Roses are red, violet are blues;
    >
    > You only go to toilet when you going to poops;
2. I assume you know some python basic knowledge. I won’t go through the basic like if-else, installation, blablabla…..

## Course Outline
The course has been structured into 4 major topics, and there will be a final assessment at the end:

- **Topic 1: File Management and processing**
- **Topic 2: Database (Postgres & MySQL)**
- **Topic 3: Data Extraction & Collection**
- **Topic 4: Machine Learning & Deep Learning**

### **Topic 1: File Management and processing**

We will start off the course with File Management and Processing using Python. For most of the people, if they wish tidy their file and folder like rename, delete, etc. in PC, they do it through UI (User Interface) or File Explorer in Windows. It is fine for most people and you should use it, since it does the job and easy to use. However, when you start doing these things repetitively, then you can consider using Python to help you. We will cover on how to use Python to automate the task and deal with different type of file including text-based file, binary file, and media file (Image & Video)

### **Topic 2: Database**

Topic 2 assume the knowledge on theory of database (lazy again, of course). It will start with introduce how to use SQL, a standard language for dealing with database. Then, we will explore on how to use Python to deal with database.

### **Topic 3: Data Extraction & Collection**

As a data scientist, data extraction or data collection will be part of your job. This topics will cover on how to use Python to extract data from different sources, including website (Web scraping, document (OCR) and text.

### **Topic 4: Machine Learning & Deep Learning**

Differ from what is commonly found in the ML & DL tutorial online, this course approach ML topic from a different perspective. Instead of looking into category of ML such as supervised, unsupervised, regression, classification, etc., this course will approach ML subject from the type of data. It will cover the two major data type, structured and unstructured data, and explore the ML option around it.

## Course Delivery Structure
For every topics, there will be subtopics that explore different elements around the topic. Every subtopics will consists of three parts, article, exercise, and challenge. The article is like a getting started guide to introduce to the subtopic, and there are a bunch of great online resources that explore around the subject. 

This course is not meant to reinvent the wheel, so the article won’t shows the exact python code and explain everything, but provide the link to these great resources. Of course, just reading or watching these resources won’t make you actually learn much. In this course, there is exercise for you to complete, where you need to complete the quiz or small exercise, and the answer can be found in the link provided. 

Lastly, challenge is where you will put everything you learn together and solve a problem. There will be different ways to solve the problem, it is the time that you get creative and apply what you learn. Lastly, I will shows you my solution to the challenge and provide feedback on your solution.
